# Battleship Project 🚢⚔️

Welcome to my Battleship project! This is where I've honed my skills in web development using pure HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. 🎉

## Overview

In this project, I've created a Battleship game from scratch, leveraging the power of modern web development tools like Webpack and Prettier to streamline my workflow and ensure code quality. 💻✨

## Key Features

- **Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**: No frameworks or libraries, just pure, unadulterated code.
- **Webpack**: Bundling all my code into a single, optimized JavaScript bundle for efficient loading.
- **Prettier**: Keeping my codebase clean and consistent with automatic code formatting.
- **Jest Testing**: Achieving 100% test coverage with Jest to ensure reliability and robustness.
- **User Input Handling**: Tackling the challenge of taking user input and dynamically updating the game board.
- **Debugging Mastery**: Overcoming setbacks through relentless debugging and problem-solving.

## Acknowledgements

I'd like to express my gratitude to EZSnippet (Neeraj Walia) and Aryan Singh as well as my seniors at ElevanceTechnology for their invaluable insights and encouragement throughout this project. Their support and guidance have been instrumental in my journey as a developer. 🙌

## Challenges and Solutions

### Setbacks Faced:
- **User Input Handling**: Initially struggled with efficiently handling user input and updating the game board accordingly.
- **Testing**: Found it challenging to achieve 100% test coverage, especially for factory functions.

### Solutions Implemented:
- **Debugging**: Resolved user input issues through persistent debugging and experimenting with different approaches.
- **Testing Strategy**: Developed a comprehensive testing strategy, leading to 100% test coverage for factory functions.

## Tech Stack

- **Webpack**: Module bundler for JavaScript applications.
- **Prettier**: Code formatter to maintain code consistency.
- **Jest**: JavaScript testing framework for unit testing.
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: The core technologies powering the Battleship game.
